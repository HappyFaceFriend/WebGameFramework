# Web Game Framework
A simple game framework using HTML and Javascript (Web game teaching, October 2018)

## Framework's core ideas
`framework.js` provides some core functionalities of making a game.
- Scene class with update & render functions.
- Preloading images and avoidance of duplicate image loading.
- GameImage class with translation, rotation, scale, z-axis control.

`game.js` demonstrates most of the functions above.
